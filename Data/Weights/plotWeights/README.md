These are the weights used for generating the plots in our paper _Fourier Feature Networks for High-Fidelity Prediction of Perturbed Optical Fibre_

These models are all trained to predict the complex weights of the first 20 modes (10 for each polarization) given mode 0 (OAM_0,1) as the input using the data generated by M. W. Matth√®s, Y. Bromberg, J. de Rosny and S. M. Popoff: https://github.com/wavefrontshaping/article_MMF_disorder
