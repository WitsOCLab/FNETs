These are the weights used for generating the plots in our paper _Fourier Feature Networks for High-Fidelity Prediction of Perturbed Optical Fibre_

These models are all trained to predict the complex transmission matrix for the first 20 modes (10 for each polarization) using the data generated by M. W. Matthès, Y. Bromberg, J. de Rosny and S. M. Popoff: https://github.com/wavefrontshaping/article_MMF_disorder
